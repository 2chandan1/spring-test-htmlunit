Provides integration between Spring MVC Test Framework and HtmlUnit.

{% endcapture %}

{% capture main_content %}

This projectâ€™s aim is to provide integration between Spring MVC Test Framework and HtmlUnit. This simplifies performing end to end testing when using HTML based views. Spring MVC Test HtmlUnit enables developers to:

* Easily test pages using tools (i.e. HtmlUnit, WebDriver, & Geb) that we already use for integration testing without starting an application server

* Support testing of JavaScript

* Optionally test using mock services to speed up testing.
